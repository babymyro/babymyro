          Many may ask, what is Myro? Myro is the name of the dog owned by Raj
          Gokal, one of the co-founders of Solana. This project pays homage to
          him, and his dog, and responds to the popular demand for dog-based
          narratives in the crypto space. Myro was created in response to this
          demand, and to provide value to the ecosystem created by Raj and his
          partner â€” the Solana blockchain.

          <br />
          <br />
          Myro is more than just a cryptocurrency, it is also a movement. We
          believe that Solana has the potential to change the world for the
          better, and we are committed to making it more inclusive and welcoming
          for everyone.
